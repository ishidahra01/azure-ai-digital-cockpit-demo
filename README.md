# azure-ai-digital-cockpit-demo

This repository provides a **demonstration application of an AI agent for a vehicle digital cockpit**, built using a Small Language Model called **Phi3.5**. By leveraging user intent and profile data, this AI agent can recommend the ideal in-car environment and relevant vehicle APIs or actions, serving as a sample framework for developing your own agent in a digital cockpit setting.

## Features

- **SLM Phi3.5** based AI agent
- Fine-tuning Phi3.5 to enable **function calling**
- Multiple agents composed **without specialized frameworks** (illustrating the agent concept)
- **Streamlit**-based web demonstration application

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that the following requirements are met:

- Access to **Azure OpenAI Service**
- An **Azure Machine Learning Workspace**  
  - Sufficient quota to create and start an **NVIDIA A100 GPU** node (e.g., Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4) in a compute cluster
- Access to **Azure AI Foundry**
- Phi3.5 **already deployed** in **Model Catalog**
- Add `Storage Blob Data Contributor` to your Azure account

## Usage

1. **Clone or download** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ishidahra01/azure-ai-digital-cockpit-demo
   cd azure-ai-digital-cockpit-demo
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables** in your `.env` file (e.g., API keys, resource names).

3. **Fine-tune the Phi3.5 model** using Azure Machine Learning:
   1. Configure a compute instance in Azure ML with the necessary Conda environment and Python packages:
      ```bash
      conda activate azureml_py310_sdkv2
      pip install -r requirements.txt
	  pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
      ```
   2. Use `SFT_Synthetic_Data.ipynb` to **generate synthetic training data** for fine-tuning.
   3. Use `SFT_FN_Calling_InCar_AzureML.ipynb` to **fine-tune** the model on Azure ML.
   4. Use `SFT_FN_Calling_InCar_AzureML_Deploy.ipynb` to **deploy** the fine-tuned model as an endpoint in Azure ML.

4. **Test the Agent Workflow**:
   - Refer to `src/02_agent-workflow/02_agent_get_started.ipynb` for the initial workflow code.
   - This notebook can be run locally (e.g., in VSCode) or on Azure ML.
   - Install the necessary Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file in the repository root.

5. **Run the Agent Workflow Web Demo**:
   - Launch the Streamlit app by running the following command:
     ```bash
     streamlit run src/02_agent-workflow/02_demo_app.py
     ```

6. **[Option]Run the Agent Workflow with Autogen**:
   - Refer to `src/02_agent-workflow/02_agent_get_started.ipynb` for the initial workflow code.
   - This notebook can be run locally (e.g., in VSCode) or on Azure ML.
